<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Algebra and Arithmetic</h2>
  <p>Algebra was taught as an extension of arithmetic, introducing the use of letters as symbols for numbers. Key operations included addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomials. Students learned to handle negative numbers through careful series demonstrations.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Equations</h2>
  <p>Linear and quadratic equations were explored deeply, emphasizing manual methods like factoring and completing the square. Simultaneous equations were solved primarily by substitution and elimination without the use of matrices or determinants.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Graphics (Early Graphing)</h2>
  <p>Plotting was taught by building tables of values and manually drawing curves on graph paper. Students were introduced to Cartesian coordinates and simple relationships like lines and parabolas.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Binomial Theorem</h2>
  <p>Expansions of binomials were developed using repeated multiplication and pattern recognition. Students practiced expanding expressions like \( (a+b)^n \) by hand, observing coefficient patterns (later linked to Pascal's triangle).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Surds and Irrational Numbers</h2>
  <p>Radicals were simplified manually by factoring perfect squares and rationalizing denominators without calculators. Careful attention was given to addition, subtraction, and comparison of irrational expressions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Plane Trigonometry</h2>
  <p>Trigonometric ratios were taught geometrically, relating angles and sides in right triangles. Tables of sines, cosines, and tangents were used for calculation. Students solved triangles entirely by hand with formulas like the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Logarithms</h2>
  <p>Before electronic calculators, logarithms were crucial for simplifying multiplication and division. Students learned to use logarithmic tables and understand logarithmic properties to transform complex calculations into addition or subtraction problems.</p>
